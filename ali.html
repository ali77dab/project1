            <p>This course will introduce you to the tools and techniques you need to write your first song. You’ll look at some of the fundamentals of songwriting, building your knowledge as you progress.</p>
            <p>By the time you’re done, you’ll have gone through the process of writing your own song, working with pitch, melody, chord progressions and more.</p>

            <h3 class="block-title">2. Create a song of your own</h3>

            <p>World-renowned musician, Martin Simpson, will use the same words and techniques and we’ll check in with him each week for inspiration and guidance on the songwriting process.</p>
            <p>We’ll also talk to experts in music and psychology as well as established musicians and songwriters to find out what makes a song successful.</p>
